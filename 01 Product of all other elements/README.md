# Product of all other elements

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` would return `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`

To make it more interesting, solve this challenge without dividing.
